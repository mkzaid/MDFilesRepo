- **type**: A string with a default value of "Channel", indicating the type of the object.
- **uuid**: A unique identifier for the channel, stored as a 64-bit integer (`np.int64`).
- **channel_url**: The URL of the channel, validated as a valid URL using the `HttpUrl` type.

### Example Usage

#### UUID Generation

A unique UUID is generated by combining the current date and time (formatted as a string) with the custom `generate_uuid` function. This UUID is then converted to a 64-bit integer.

## Code Example
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, HttpUrl
import datetime
import numpy as np
from uuid_generator import generate_uuid

class Channel(BaseModel):
    type: str = "Channel"
    uuid: np.int64
    channel_url: HttpUrl

# Example usage
uuid = np.int64(generate_uuid(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")))
channel_data = {
    "uuid": uuid,
    "channel_url": "https://www.youtube.com/@zytedata",
}

# Create an instance of Channel
channel = Channel(**channel_data)

# Convert to JSON
json_str = channel.json()
print(json_str)

# Parse from JSON
parsed_channel = Channel.parse_raw(json_str)
print(parsed_channel)
```

# VideoPage

This Python script defines a data model called `VideoPage` using the `pydantic` library, which is useful for data validation and settings management. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code.

## Code Overview

### Importing Necessary Dependencies

The following libraries and modules are imported:

- **BaseModel, Field, and HttpUrl**: Imported from `pydantic` for defining and validating data models. `BaseModel` serves as the base class, `Field` is used for defining fields with validation rules, and `HttpUrl` is a specialized field type that ensures the value is a valid URL.
- **datetime**: Used for working with date and time, particularly useful when generating unique identifiers (UUIDs).
- **numpy**: Imported as `np`, a library for numerical operations, specifically to handle the UUID as a 64-bit integer.
- **generate_uuid**: A custom function imported from the `uuid_generator` module, used to generate a unique identifier based on the current date and time.

### Class Definition: `VideoPage`

The `VideoPage` class inherits from `BaseModel`. This class serves as a model for storing and validating the essential information related to a video page. The class includes the following attributes:

- **type**: A string with a default value of "VideoPage", indicating the type of the object.
- **uuid**: A unique identifier for the video page, stored as a 64-bit integer (`np.int64`).
- **video_url**: The URL of the video, validated as a proper URL using the `HttpUrl` type.

### Example Usage

#### UUID Generation

A unique UUID is generated by combining the current date and time (formatted as a string) with the custom `generate_uuid` function. This UUID is then converted to a 64-bit integer.

## Code Example
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, HttpUrl
import datetime
import numpy as np
from uuid_generator import generate_uuid

class VideoPage(BaseModel):
    type: str = "VideoPage"
    uuid: np.int64
    video_url: HttpUrl

# Example usage
uuid = np.int64(generate_uuid(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")))
video_page = {
    "uuid": uuid,
    "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLosoD249NA",
}

# Create an instance of VideoPage
video_page = VideoPage(**video_page)

# Convert to JSON
json_str = video_page.json()
print(json_str)

# Parse from JSON
parsed_video_page = VideoPage.parse_raw(json_str)
print(parsed_video_page)
```

# Uuid64

The `Uuid64` class is a Python implementation designed to generate and manipulate 64-bit UUIDs based on date and time. Below is a detailed explanation of the class and its methods:

## Class (Uuid64)

The `Uuid64` class handles the creation and management of a 64-bit UUID. The class contains various methods for initializing, formatting, and converting the UUID.

### Initialization (`__init__` Method)

```python
def __init__(self):
```

- This is the constructor method that initializes an instance of `Uuid64`.
- `self._value: int = 0`: A private attribute `_value` is initialized to 0. This will later hold the 64-bit UUID.
- `self._create_value_with_date(datetime.now(timezone.utc))`: This method is called during initialization to create a UUID based on the current UTC date and time.

### String Representation (`__str__` Method)

```python
def __str__(self):
```

- This method returns a string representation of the UUID in a typical UUID format.
- The `_value` is converted to a hexadecimal string and then divided into chunks separated by hyphens to follow the UUID format (e.g., `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`).

### Static Method: `from_date_string`

```python
@staticmethod
def from_date_string(date: str, date_formats: List[str]):
```

- This method creates a `Uuid64` instance from a date string using one of the provided date formats.
- **Date Parsing**: It tries to parse the date string using each format in `date_formats`. If successful, the date is converted to a datetime object.
- **Instance Creation**: A new `Uuid64` instance is created, and the `_create_value_with_date` method is called with the parsed date to generate the UUID.

### Static Method: `from_mongo_value`

```python
@staticmethod
def from_mongo_value(value: int):
```

- This method creates a `Uuid64` instance from a 64-bit integer value (commonly used in MongoDB).
- **Validation**: It checks if the provided value is valid by comparing it to a predefined threshold (`18446744073709551615`). If not valid, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **Instance Creation**: A new `Uuid64` instance is created, and its `_value` is set to the provided integer.

### Conversion to MongoDB Value (`to_mongo_value` Method)

```python
def to_mongo_value(self):
```

- This method returns the UUID value as an integer, suitable for storing in MongoDB.

### Formatted String Conversion (`to_formatted_str` Method)

```python
def to_formatted_str(self):
```

- This method returns the UUID as a formatted string, similar to what the `__str__` method does.

### Creating Value with Date (`_create_value_with_date` Method)

```python
def _create_value_with_date(self, date_value: datetime):
```

- This method generates the 64-bit UUID using the provided date.
- **POSIX Time**: The timestamp of the date is converted into a 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **Random Number Generation**: A secure 32-bit random number is generated.
- **UUID Composition**: The final 64-bit UUID is composed by combining the 32-bit time value and the 32-bit random number.

## Summary

The `Uuid64` class is a custom implementation for generating and manipulating 64-bit UUIDs based on date and time. It allows for creating UUIDs from the current time, a specific date string, or a MongoDB value. The class also provides methods for converting the UUID to a string format and a MongoDB-compatible integer format. This implementation is useful in systems where a compact and time-based unique identifier is required.


### Code Example
```python
import secrets
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from typing import List

class Uuid64:
    _value: int = 0

    def __init__(self):
        # Create with the current UTC date.
        self._create_value_with_date(datetime.now(timezone.utc))

    def __str__(self):
        hex_string = self._value.to_bytes(8, 'big').hex()
        return (hex_string[0:4] + '-' + hex_string[4:8] + '-' + hex_string[8:12] + '-' + hex_string[12:16]).upper()

    @staticmethod
    def from_date_string(date: str, date_formats: List[str]):
        if not date_formats:
            raise ValueError(f"date_formats must include at least one format")
        for fmt in date_formats:
            try:
                date_value = datetime.strptime(date, fmt)
                break
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"time data '{date}' does not match any of the provided formats")
        instance = Uuid64()
        instance._create_value_with_date(date_value)
        return instance

    @staticmethod
    def from_mongo_value(value: int):
        if value < 0 or value > 18446744073709551615:
            raise ValueError(f"the value is not a valid uuid")
        instance = Uuid64()
        instance._value = value
        return instance

    def to_mongo_value(self):
        return self._value

    def to_formatted_str(self):
        return str(self)

    def _create_value_with_date(self, date_value: datetime):
        unix_time_32bit = int(date_value.timestamp()) & 0xFFFFFFFF
        random_32bit = int(secrets.randbits(32)) & 0xFFFFFFFF
        self._value = (random_32bit & 0xFFFFFFFF) | (unix_time_32bit << 32)
