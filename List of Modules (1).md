  * The JSON string is parsed back into a VideoPage instance using the parse_raw method, demonstrating how to deserialize the JSON data back into a Python object.

**Summary:**

This script demonstrates how to define a VideoPage data model using pydantic to manage and validate information about a video page. The model includes fields such as a UUID and a validated URL, making it suitable for handling video-related data. The example shows how to generate a UUID, create an instance of the model, serialize it to JSON, and then deserialize it back into a Python object.

It shows the implementation of a Uuid64 class in Python, which is designed to generate and manipulate 64-bit UUIDs based on date and time. Here's a detailed explanation of the class and its methods:

---

**1. Class (Uuid64):**

**class Uuid64:**: This defines the Uuid64 class, which handles the creation and management of a 64-bit UUID. The class contains various methods for initializing, formatting, and converting the UUID.

**2. Initialization (__init__ Method):**

* **def __init__(self):**: This is the constructor method that initializes an instance of Uuid64.  
  * **self._value: int = 0**: A private attribute _value is initialized to 0. This will later hold the 64-bit UUID.  
  * **self._create_value_with_date(datetime.now(timezone.utc))**: This method is called during initialization to create a UUID based on the current UTC date and time.

**3. String Representation (__str__ Method):**

* **def __str__(self):**: This method returns a string representation of the UUID in a typical UUID format.  
  * The _value is converted to a hexadecimal string and then divided into chunks separated by hyphens to follow the UUID format (e.g., 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000).

**4. Static Method: from_date_string:**

* **@staticmethod def from_date_string(date: str, date_formats: List[str])**: This method creates a Uuid64 instance from a date string using one of the provided date formats.  
  * **Date Parsing**: It tries to parse the date string using each format in date_formats. If successful, the date is converted to a datetime object.  
  * **Instance Creation**: A new Uuid64 instance is created, and the _create_value_with_date method is called with the parsed date to generate the UUID.

**5. Static Method: from_mongo_value:**

* **@staticmethod def from_mongo_value(value: int)**: This method creates a Uuid64 instance from a 64-bit integer value (commonly used in MongoDB).  
  * **Validation**: It checks if the provided value is valid by comparing it to a predefined threshold (18446744073709551615). If not valid, it raises a ValueError.  
  * **Instance Creation**: A new Uuid64 instance is created, and its _value is set to the provided integer.

**6. Conversion to MongoDB Value (to_mongo_value Method):**

* **def to_mongo_value(self):**: This method returns the UUID value as an integer, suitable for storing in MongoDB.

**7. Formatted String Conversion (to_formatted_str Method):**

**def to_formatted_str(self)::** This method returns the UUID as a formatted string, similar to what the __str__ method does.

**8. Creating Value with Date (_create_value_with_date Method):**

* **def _create_value_with_date(self, date_value: datetime)**: This method generates the 64-bit UUID using the provided date.  
  * **POSIX Time**: The timestamp of the date is converted into a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
  * **Random Number Generation**: A secure 32-bit random number is generated.  
  * **UUID Composition**: The final 64-bit UUID is composed by combining the 32-bit time value and the 32-bit random number.

**Summary:**

The Uuid64 class is a custom implementation for generating and manipulating 64-bit UUIDs based on date and time. It allows for creating UUIDs from the current time, a specific date string, or a MongoDB value. The class also provides methods for converting the UUID to a string format and a MongoDB-compatible integer format. This implementation is useful in systems where a compact and time-based unique identifier is required.
